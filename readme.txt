Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.2.1
Stable tag: trunk

Allows administrators to globally disable comments on their site. Comments can be disabled according to post type.

== Description ==

This plugin allows administrators to globally disable comments on any post types (posts, pages, attachments, etc.) so that these settings cannot be overridden for individual posts. It also removes all comment-related fields from edit and quick-edit screens.

Use this plugin if you don't want comments at all on your site (or on certain post types). Don't use it if you want to selectively disable comments on individual posts - WordPress lets you do that anyway.

It requires PHP version 5 or greater.
